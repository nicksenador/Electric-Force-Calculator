# Electric-Force-Calculator
TI-Basic. Calculates the electric force for two or more point charges.

This program solves a problem where we want to know the net electric force on a point charge from one or more other point charges.

It will ask the user the enter the charge of the point charge the user is interested in. It will then ask for how many other charges are acting on the interested point charge. For all of the other point charges, the program will ask for the distance between the other charge and interested charge, and it will then ask for the direction of the force acting on the interested charge. This is up to the user to decide which direction the force is. The program takes the sum of all of these vectors and outputs the net force.
